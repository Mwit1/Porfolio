## How it all started

When I set out to create my personal developer site, I didn‚Äôt want just another template. I wanted something bold, fast, and unforgettable. Something from CyberPunk 2077

Every detail mattered: the shadows, the curves, the color palette, the hover effects ‚Äî all engineered for aesthetic velocity and smooth UX handling. I wanted a site that not only told my story but felt like tech in motion and also include cool [404 page](/404) just in case it crashes.

## Why I Decided to Build My Own Portfolio
As a graduate and developer, I realized sending CVs wasn't enough. I needed a digital space that:

- Showcased my projects
- Told my story
- Looked professional
- Could evolve with my skills

And most importantly, a space that said: ‚ÄúThis is me, and this is what I can build.‚Äù

## Tech Stack I Used

After trying a few static site generators and themes, I settled on:

- Framework: Next.js ‚Äî for fast performance and dynamic routing
- Styling: TailwindCSS ‚Äî utility-first and beautiful
- MDX: For writing blog articles like this one, with embedded JSX
- Hosting: Vercel ‚Äî 1-click deployment
- Version Control: Git + GitHub ‚Äî to build in public and track progress

## Why You Should Build Your Own Portfolio

- You control the narrative ‚Äî not LinkedIn or Upwork
- You learn frontend + deployment skills in the process
- You stand out in a sea of templated resumes
- You build in public ‚Äî showing growth and transparency

People hire people they trust. And nothing builds trust like a public trail of effort, learning, and passion.

## Learning Journey
Let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äî I wasn‚Äôt the most serious student in university. I showed up, did the group projects, aced the presentations (somehow), and thought I was ready to conquer the tech world. Then reality hit me like a when i saw TypeError: undefined is not a function.

When I graduated and sat in front of my laptop to ‚Äúbuild something,‚Äù. I realized I had a degree, but no idea how the web actually worked. Flexbox was a myth. JavaScript had many colors. I thought React was just good PR for HTML.
### Getting My Hands Dirty ‚Äî The Real Learning Begins

After graduation, I gave myself a mission: become a full-stack JavaScript developer. My early tools and resources were:

- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)  Great for hands-on tasks
- [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/)  Deep dives into the language
- YouTube Channels  
- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)  Always open in a tab

But i found [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) The best website as it is very systematic and has the best study links for any Language or Framework

## Challenges I Faced

- Imposter Syndrome: Seeing senior devs solve problems I couldn‚Äôt even understand. (still im to this day)
- JavaScript Fatigue: ES6, callbacks, promises, arrow functions‚Ä¶ I kept feeling like I was behind.
- Debugging Hell: Spent hours on bugs that were just missing curly braces 

I tried learning everything at once: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, Git, Firebase, Tailwind, TypeScript... and for some reason, I thought it was a good idea to build a fullstack dashboard from scratch on day 1.

There were nights I‚Äôd watch 8 hours of tutorials and still not understand what a closure was. I broke my app trying to center a button. I copy-pasted Stack Overflow answers like a surgeon .  don‚Äôt  get me started on the Event Loop 

## ü§ì Where I Am Now
Slowly (painfully), things started making sense. I began to understand not just what the code did, but why it worked. I stopped building for the tutorial, and started building for me ‚Äî little tools, dashboards, even a portfolio.

And I realized: JavaScript isn‚Äôt something you just ‚Äúfinish learning‚Äù. It‚Äôs a marathon where the finish line keeps moving ‚Äî especially when you add frameworks like React, Next.js, Vue, Astro, and tools like Vite, Zustand, Prisma, etc.

I‚Äôm still learning. Every day. Every line of code teaches me something new. But now, I embrace the confusion, the bugs, the 3am ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moments, and the slow but steady climb from "I have no idea what I'm doing" to "Hey, that actually worked!"
